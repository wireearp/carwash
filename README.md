Let me know if you have any further questions or adjustments before we proceed!

[car wash app outline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19mt6luLKnThCVMvZ7nofs9Wt9xmWyOqzEYejIKH7P8k/edit?usp=drive_web)

[Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19mt6luLKnThCVMvZ7nofs9Wt9xmWyOqzEYejIKH7P8k/edit?usp=drive_web)
